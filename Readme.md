# Telegram Bot: webp2u

## About

Your friend likes to send you memes in webp, but it pisses you off to open links in the browser?
This bot responds to messages with a webp message with a jpeg, so that you no longer have to leave the telegram to watch a funny meme.

## Installation

Just add the [@webp2ubot](http://t.me/webp2u_dev_bot) bot to your chat and enjoy the good old jpeg pictures.

Or you can run this bot on your server if you want to keep the memes closer to the body.
